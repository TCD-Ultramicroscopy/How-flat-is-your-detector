# How flat is your detector?

This repository contains code to accompany the paper "How Fast is Your Detector? The Effect of Temporal Response on Image Quality" by T. Mullarkey, M. Geever, J. J. P. Peters, I. Griffiths, P. D. Nellist, and L. Jones.

This repository contains the code use to replicate the metrics from "How flat is your detector? Non-uniform annular detector sensitivity in STEM quantification" by K. E. MacArthur, L. Jones, and P. D. Nellist.

## Use

The script entry point is in `__main__.py`, there are several parameters to be set at the top of the file. These include the input image, an option input mask, image shift and rotation, as well as a threshold to determine the active region of the detector map.
